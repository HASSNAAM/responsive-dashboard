# Products Responsive Dashboard

## Overview

Welcome to the Products Dashboard! This is my playground to mess around with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a simple yet stylish dashboard to show off some imaginary products.

## Features

- **Slick Sidebar**: A cool sidebar that expands when you hover over it.
- **Dashboard Stats**: Shows random numbers for users, posts, products, and revenue because why not?
- **Product Table**: 100 made-up products with prices and stock counts.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: To hold everything together.
- **CSS**: To make it look pretty.
- **JavaScript**: To bring it to life.
- **Font Awesome**: For those nifty icons.

## Future Dreams

- Make it do real stuff with a backend.
- Add user login so you can pretend to sign in.

## Shoutouts

- **Font Awesome**: For the awesome icons.
- **Coffee**: For keeping me awake while I coded this.

Enjoy the dashboard! ðŸ˜Ž
